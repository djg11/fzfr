# fzfr — TODO / Roadmap

---

## Multi-Host Search

Search across multiple remote machines simultaneously, aggregating results into a single fzf session.

**Command-line syntax:**
```sh
fzfr remote1:/path1 remote2:/path2
fzfr web01:/var/log web02:/var/log web03:/var/log
```

**Implementation notes:**
- Each `host:path` pair maps to a `RemoteBackend` instance
- Run N searches in parallel using `threading` (not asyncio — subprocess is the bottleneck)
- Prefix each result with its source host: `web01:/var/log/app.log`
- Strip the host prefix when passing the selected path to preview/open
- Reload path: every keystroke re-queries all hosts in parallel and merges stdout into fzf stdin
- Config: allow defining named host groups for frequently used combinations

**Complexity:** High

## Docker Backend

Search and preview files inside running Docker containers without manual `docker exec` commands.

**Implementation notes:**
- New `DockerBackend` class modelled on `RemoteBackend`
- Replace `ssh <host>` with `docker exec <container>` throughout
- Use the same script-over-stdin technique for remote preview
- Container discovery via `docker ps` for tab-completion or a container picker
- No multiplexing equivalent for docker exec (each call is independent)
- Requirement: container must have `python3.10+` and `fd` in its PATH, same as SSH

**Complexity:** Medium (≈80% code reuse from `RemoteBackend`)

---

## Git Integration

Make fzfr Git-aware for more relevant results and richer contextual previews.

**Implementation notes (incremental):**

1. **`git ls-files` mode** — use `git ls-files` as the file source instead of `fd`; faster and respects `.gitignore` exactly. Lowest effort, highest immediate value.
2. **Enhanced preview** — show `git log --oneline -5` and `git status` for the selected file alongside the content preview.
3. **Commit history search** — new mode `fzfr git-log` to search commit messages; preview shows the full diff for the highlighted commit.
4. **Open on remote** — keybinding to open the selected file on GitHub/GitLab in the browser.

**Complexity:** Medium (implement incrementally, start with `git ls-files`)

---

## Interactive File Operations

Manage files directly from the fzf interface after finding them.

**Implementation notes:**
- `rm` — `_tty_prompt` for mandatory `[y/N]` confirmation before deletion; confirmation must be non-skippable
- `mv` / `cp` — launch a nested fzfr instance in directory mode to fuzzy-find the destination folder
- All operations work on the current selection (`{+}` for multi-select)
- Start with `rm` only; add `mv`/`cp` once `rm` is proven solid

**Complexity:** Low (leverages existing fzf patterns and `_tty_prompt`)
